PHASE 2: Add New Educational Modules & Legal Infrastructure

Create 3 new comprehensive training modules and supporting pages with the same quality and structure as existing modules:

MODULE 9: UNDERSTANDING AI - WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

Structure:
- Opening Story: "Margaret's AI Encounter"
  * Margaret sees a friend's photo that looks "too perfect"
  * Worries it might be fake or manipulated
  * Learns about helpful AI vs. concerning deepfakes
  * Ends confidently using AI photo enhancement herself

- What is AI? (LLM 101 in Plain Language)
  * "Think of it as a very smart autocomplete that learned from reading millions of books and websites"
  * It predicts what words should come next, like your phone's keyboard but much more advanced
  * Examples you already use: Siri, Google Assistant, autocorrect, photo sorting
  * NOT science fiction robots, NOT sentient, NOT magical
  * IS a helpful tool like a calculator or dictionary

- Should I Be Scared?
  * Short answer: No! But be informed and careful
  * AI is a tool - like a car, it's safe when used properly
  * Same common sense applies as with any new technology
  * The real concern is people using AI for scams (just like they use phones and email)

- What to Look Out For:
  * **Deepfake Videos/Audio**
    - AI can make realistic fake videos of people saying things they never said
    - Often used for: political misinformation, celebrity scams, impersonating family members
    - How to spot: Unnatural blinking, lip-sync slightly off, weird lighting on face
    - The 3-Second Rule: If a video seems shocking, pause and verify through official sources

  * **AI-Generated Scam Emails**
    - Scammers now use AI to write more convincing emails
    - Grammar is better, sounds more "human"
    - Still has red flags: urgency, asking for money/info, unknown sender
    - Apply same security rules from Module 2

  * **Fake Photos**
    - AI can create realistic photos of events that never happened
    - Politicians "saying" things they never said
    - Fake product reviews with AI-generated photos
    - Check: Does this photo appear on reputable news sites?

  * **Voice Cloning Scams (The "Grandparent Scam" 2.0)**
    - Scammers can clone a loved one's voice from social media videos
    - "Grandma, it's me! I'm in trouble and need money!"
    - Defense: Use a family code word, call the person back on their known number
    - The 3-Second Rule applies: Stop, Breathe, Verify

- Privacy Concerns with AI Tools:
  * **Don't share personal information with AI chatbots**
    - Your conversations might be saved and used to improve the AI
    - Avoid: Social insurance numbers, banking info, passwords, addresses
    - OK: General questions, recipe ideas, how-to instructions

  * **Companies may save your data**
    - Free AI services often keep your questions and answers
    - Photos you upload might be stored on their servers
    - Read privacy policies (look for "data retention" and "how we use your information")

  * **Use privacy-focused options when available**
    - Some AI tools have "private mode" or "incognito" settings
    - Look for Canadian or privacy-first companies
    - Your iPad's built-in AI features (photo enhancement) stay on your device

- Beginner-Friendly AI Tools to Try (Safe & Fun):
  1. **iPhone/iPad Photo Enhancement (Built-in, Completely Safe)**
     - Your Photos app uses AI to improve brightness, color, sharpness
     - Tap "Edit" on any photo → Tap the magic wand icon → See instant improvement
     - All processing happens on YOUR device (Apple doesn't see your photos)
     - Try it on: old family photos, dim pictures, blurry shots

  2. **Google Lens (Identify Objects, Translate Text)**
     - Point your camera at a plant → Google tells you what it is
     - Point at foreign language text → See instant translation
     - Point at a product → Find where to buy it
     - Available: Free Google app or built into Android cameras

  3. **ChatGPT for Everyday Help (Free Version)**
     - Ask for recipe ideas using ingredients you have
     - Get help writing a thank-you letter or email
     - Explain complex topics in simple language
     - Safety: Don't share personal details, use for general questions only
     - Access: chat.openai.com (free account needed)

- Video Lab (3 curated videos on AI basics for seniors):
  1. "What is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply" - TED-Ed (5 min)
  2. "How to Spot Deepfake Videos" - CBC News (7 min)
  3. "Safe AI Tools for Beginners" - AARP Tech (8 min)

- Practical Exercise: Try One Safe AI Tool
  * Choose ONE from the list above
  * Try it for 5 minutes with something low-stakes (a family photo, a plant in your house)
  * Notice how it feels - exciting? confusing? helpful?
  * Checkbox: ✓ I tried an AI tool and survived! 😊

- Confidence Check:
  "You're doing wonderfully! AI might seem mysterious, but you now know more about it than most people. You understand what to watch for, and you know it's just a tool - not magic, not scary. Your device is still safe, and you're in control."
