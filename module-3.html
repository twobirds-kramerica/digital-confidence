        <span class="story-label">Helen's Story</span>
        <p>Helen, 69, from {{NEIGHBORHOOD}}, had one password for everything: her late husband's name followed by their anniversary year. She used it for her email, her bank, her iPad, Amazon, Facebook — everything. "It's easy to remember," she told her daughter.</p>
        <p>Then one day, Helen noticed strange purchases on her Amazon account — three expensive Bluetooth speakers she had never ordered. Someone had figured out her password (it turns out her husband's name and their anniversary were both on her Facebook profile) and used it to get into her Amazon account. Because Helen used the same password everywhere, the thief also tried it on her email — and got in.</p>
        <p>Helen spent two stressful weeks changing passwords, calling her bank, and locking down her accounts. But the experience taught her something she now shares with every friend: "One password for everything is like one key for your house, your car, and your safety deposit box. If someone copies that key, they get into everything."</p>
        <p>Today, Helen uses Face ID and a password manager. She says managing her passwords is now easier than it was before — and far, far safer.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Security Terms in Plain Language</h2>

      <p>Before we go further, let us define some words you might hear. Think of this as your personal dictionary:</p>

      <div class="tip-block">
        <span class="tip-label">Your Security Dictionary</span>
        <p><strong>Password:</strong> A secret word or phrase that proves you are who you say you are. Like a key to a lock.</p>
        <p><strong>Biometrics:</strong> Using your body to prove your identity — your face, your fingerprint, or even your voice. "Bio" means life, and "metrics" means measurement. So biometrics means "measuring something about you."</p>
        <p><strong>Face ID:</strong> Apple's system that uses the front camera on your iPad or iPhone to recognise your face. It is like a security guard who knows what you look like and opens the door when they see you.</p>
        <p><strong>Touch ID:</strong> Apple's fingerprint reader, found on older iPads and iPhones. You press your finger on the Home button and it recognises your unique fingerprint.</p>
        <p><strong>Face Unlock / Fingerprint Unlock:</strong> Android's version of the same idea. Many Android phones and tablets can recognise your face or your fingerprint to unlock your device and confirm your identity.</p>
        <p><strong>Password Manager:</strong> A secure digital vault that remembers all your passwords for you. You only need to remember one master password — the vault remembers the rest.</p>
        <p><strong>Two-Factor Authentication (also called 2FA or "two-step verification"):</strong> An extra security step when you log in. After typing your password, you also need a second proof — usually a code sent to your phone. It is like a door that needs both a key and a secret knock.</p>
        <p><strong>Apple ID:</strong> Your personal account with Apple. It is the email address and password you use to download apps, use iCloud, and access Apple services. Think of it as your membership card for everything Apple.</p>
        <p><strong>Google Account:</strong> Your personal account with Google. It is the email address (usually Gmail) and password you use to download apps from the Play Store, back up your data, and access Google services. Think of it as your membership card for everything on your Android device.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="confidence-check">
        <span class="check-icon">💛</span>
        <p>Confidence Check: Those terms are not so scary when they are explained properly, are they? You are building your tech vocabulary.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Biometrics: Your Face or Fingerprint Is Your Password</h2>

      <p>Modern devices can recognise you by your face or fingerprint. This is one of the most convenient and secure ways to protect your device.</p>

      <div class="device-content" data-devices="iphone,ipad">
      <h3>Face ID on iPad and iPhone</h3>

      <p>If your iPad or iPhone is a newer model, it likely has Face ID.</p>

      <p><strong>How Face ID works:</strong> When you set up Face ID, your device takes a detailed map of your face using special sensors. It does not take a regular photograph — it creates a mathematical model of the shape of your face. This model is stored only on your device (it is never sent to Apple or anyone else). When you pick up your device and look at the screen, it checks: "Is this the same face?" If yes, it unlocks.</p>

        <p>Face ID works with glasses on or off, and it adapts as your appearance changes gradually over time. It does not work with a face covering, so you may need your passcode when wearing a mask. Face ID will also not let someone unlock your device while you are sleeping — your eyes need to be open and looking at the screen.</p>

      <h3>Fingerprint and Face Unlock on Android</h3>

      <p>Most Android phones and tablets come with a fingerprint reader, and many newer models also offer face unlock. The fingerprint reader is usually found on the back of the device, on the side (built into the power button), or under the screen itself. Setting it up is straightforward and takes just a couple of minutes.</p>

        <p>Android fingerprint unlock is very reliable and works even if your hands are slightly damp. Face unlock on Android is convenient, but on most devices it is slightly less secure than fingerprint — some models can be unlocked with a good photograph. For best security, use fingerprint as your primary method and face unlock as a backup. You can have both set up at the same time.</p>

      <h3>Windows Hello: PIN, Face, and Fingerprint on Windows</h3>

      <p>Windows computers have a built-in sign-in system called <strong>Windows Hello</strong>. It lets you sign in with a PIN, your face (on computers with the right camera), or a fingerprint (on computers with a fingerprint reader). A Windows Hello PIN is especially useful — it is different from your Microsoft account password, and it only works on that specific computer.</p>

      <div class="walkthrough">
        <h4>Setting Up a Windows Hello PIN</h4>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">1</span>

        <p>Your Windows Hello PIN is tied to your specific computer — it cannot be used anywhere else. This means even if someone finds your PIN written down, they cannot use it to access your account from another device. It is safe to write your PIN on paper and store it securely.</p>

      </div>

      <h2>Creating Strong Passwords</h2>

      <p>For accounts where you still need a typed password, here is how to make a good one:</p>

      <div class="danger-block">
        <span class="danger-label">Weak Passwords (Do Not Use These)</span>
        <p>123456, password, your name, your pet's name, your birthday, your anniversary, your address, "qwerty," or any single word found in the dictionary.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <span class="warning-box-label">Watch Out</span>
        <p>Using the same password for multiple accounts is like using the same key for your house, your car, and your safety deposit box. If a thief copies that one key, they get into everything.</p>
      </div>

      <p>A strong password is like a strong lock — it has multiple parts that work together. The best way to create one is the <strong>passphrase method</strong>:</p>

      <div class="tip-block">
        <span class="tip-label">The Passphrase Method</span>
        <p>Instead of a single word, use a short phrase of random words. For example:</p>
        <p><strong>Purple-Teacup-Bridge-44</strong></p>
        <p>This is much harder for a computer to guess than "MyName1954" but much easier for you to remember. You can picture a purple teacup sitting on a bridge with the number 44 on it. The sillier the image, the easier it is to remember.</p>
        <p>More examples: <strong>Garden-Rabbit-Snow-17</strong> or <strong>Kitchen-River-Maple-82</strong></p>
      </div>

      <div class="image-placeholder" role="img" aria-label="Visual example of a passphrase — Purple-Teacup-Bridge-44">
        <div class="placeholder-inner">
          <div class="placeholder-icon-wrap">🔑</div>
          <div class="placeholder-text-wrap">
            <span class="placeholder-label">Screenshot needed</span>
            <p class="placeholder-caption">Visual example of a passphrase — Purple-Teacup-Bridge-44</p>
            <p class="placeholder-dims">Recommended: 800 × 400 px</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>The key rules for passwords:</p>
      <ul class="content-list">
        <li><strong>Never use the same password twice.</strong> Each account should have its own unique password.</li>
        <li><strong>Never share your passwords</strong> with anyone — not even someone who says they are from Apple or your bank.</li>
        <li><strong>Make them long.</strong> A 16-character passphrase is far stronger than an 8-character password with random symbols.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="confidence-check">
        <span class="check-icon">💛</span>

      <h2>Password Managers: Your Digital Vault</h2>

      <p>"But how am I supposed to remember a different password for every account?" Great question. The answer is: you are not. A password manager does it for you.</p>

      <div class="device-content" data-devices="iphone,ipad">
      <p>Your iPad comes with a built-in password manager called <strong>iCloud Keychain</strong>. Here is what it does:</p>

        <li>When you return to that website, your iPad <strong>fills in the password automatically</strong> — you do not need to type it.</li>
        <li>It can <strong>suggest strong passwords</strong> when you are creating a new account.</li>
        <li>It <strong>warns you</strong> if one of your saved passwords has been found in a data breach.</li>

      <h2>Two-Factor Authentication: The Double Lock</h2>

      <p>Imagine your front door had two locks — a regular lock and a deadbolt. Even if someone copied your key, they still could not get in without also having the deadbolt key. That is what two-factor authentication does for your online accounts.</p>

      <p>When you turn on two-factor authentication (let us call it "the double lock"), logging in works like this:</p>

      <ol class="numbered-list">
        <li>You type your password as usual (the first lock).</li>
        <li>The website sends a <strong>short code</strong> (usually 6 numbers) to your phone or iPad (the second lock).</li>
        <li>You type that code into the website.</li>
        <li>Now the website knows it is really you — because even if someone stole your password, they would also need your phone to get the code.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Your Apple ID already uses two-factor authentication by default. When you sign in on a new device, Apple sends a code to your other devices. This is normal and it is protecting you.</p>
