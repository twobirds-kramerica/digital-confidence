      <h1>Module 7: Photos &amp; Creative Joy</h1>
      <p><strong>What you will learn:</strong> The fun stuff! Your iPad is not just a tool for email and banking — it is a canvas for creativity, a photo album that never fills up, and a window into art and music. This module is about discovering joy in your device.</p>

        <span class="story-label">Betty's Story</span>
        <p>Betty, 78, from South Windsor, had always loved painting watercolours. When arthritis made it harder to hold a brush, she thought her painting days were over. Then her granddaughter showed her a drawing app on the iPad.</p>
        <p>"At first I thought it was silly — painting with your finger on a piece of glass," Betty laughs. "But then I discovered you could choose any colour instantly, undo a mistake with one tap, and zoom in to add tiny details. I painted my first digital watercolour that afternoon — a cardinal sitting on the fence in my backyard."</p>
        <p>Betty now paints on her iPad every evening after dinner. She emails her paintings to friends, prints them out as greeting cards, and recently started an online gallery that her grandchildren helped her set up. "This little device gave me my art back," she says.</p>

        <li><strong>Albums:</strong> You can create albums to group photos together — like "Garden 2025," "Grandchildren," or "Recipes." Tap the <strong>Albums</strong> tab at the bottom of the Photos app, then tap the <strong>"+"</strong> button to create a new album.</li>
        <li><strong>Favourites:</strong> When viewing a photo, tap the <strong>heart icon</strong> to mark it as a favourite. All your favourites appear in a special "Favourites" album for quick access.</li>
        <li><strong>Search:</strong> The Photos app can recognise what is in your photos. Tap the <strong>Search</strong> tab and type something like "beach" or "birthday" or even "dog" — your iPad will find matching photos.</li>
        <li><strong>Memories:</strong> Your iPad automatically creates slideshows from your photos, set to music. Look for the <strong>"For You"</strong> tab to see these. They can be quite lovely.</li>

          <li><strong>Take five photos</strong> of things you find beautiful around your home — a vase of flowers, a favourite book, the view from your window, your pet, or your morning coffee.</li>

          <li><strong>Create a favourites album.</strong> Go to Albums → tap "+" → name it something like "My Beautiful Things" and add your five photos.</li>
          <li><strong>Try a drawing app.</strong> Download "Paper by WeTransfer" from the App Store and draw anything — a flower, a face, your name. There are no rules.</li>
          <li><strong>Send your favourite creation to someone you love.</strong> Share a photo or drawing with a family member using Messages or Mail.</li>
