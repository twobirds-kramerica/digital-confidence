      <h1>Module 11: Ride-Sharing Apps — Uber &amp; Lyft</h1>
      <p><strong>What you will learn:</strong> How to request a safe ride using Uber or Lyft, how to verify your driver before getting in, how to share your trip with a family member, and what to do if you ever feel unsafe.</p>

      <div class="story-block">
        <span class="story-label">Robert Tries Uber for the First Time</span>
        <p>Robert, 76, from {{CITY}}, had always driven himself everywhere. When his car went in for a week-long repair, he faced a dilemma: a doctor's appointment across town, and no way to get there. Taxis seemed expensive and unreliable. His daughter suggested Uber.</p>
        <p>"I do not want a stranger driving me around," Robert said. But his daughter showed him how the app worked — you could see the driver's name, photo, car model, and licence plate before they even arrived. Other passengers had rated this driver 4.9 out of 5 over 2,000 trips. That made Robert feel much better.</p>
        <p>The driver arrived exactly on time. Robert checked the licence plate against the app — a match. The driver greeted him by name without being asked. The ride was comfortable and professional. Robert tracked the route on his phone the whole way, knowing his daughter could see his location too.</p>
        <p>He made his appointment with ten minutes to spare. He now uses Uber monthly — especially for early morning flights when he does not want to impose on his children. "It is actually more comfortable than a taxi," he says. "And I feel safer because I can see everything before I get in."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-block">
        <span class="tip-label">What Is Ride-Sharing?</span>
        <p>Ride-sharing apps connect you with local, screened drivers through your smartphone. You request a ride, a nearby driver accepts, and picks you up. Payment is automatic — no cash needed. You see the driver's name, photo, car details, and licence plate before they arrive, and you know the price upfront.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>🚗 Uber — Complete Beginner's Guide</h2>

      <h3>Step 1: Download and Set Up</h3>

      <div class="walkthrough">
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">1</span>
          <span class="step-text">Open the <strong>App Store</strong> (iPhone/iPad) or <strong>Google Play Store</strong> (Android). Search for <strong>"Uber."</strong> The icon is black with white "Uber" text. Download the free app.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">2</span>
          <span class="step-text">Tap <strong>Create Account.</strong> Enter your phone number — you will receive a verification code by text message. Enter the code to verify your identity.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">3</span>
          <span class="step-text">Enter your name and email address. Then add your payment method — a credit or debit card. This is stored securely and encrypted.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">4</span>
          <span class="step-text">Allow location access when prompted. This lets Uber show you nearby drivers and know where to pick you up. You can always type a manual pickup address instead.</span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Step 2: Requesting Your Ride</h3>

      <div class="walkthrough">
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">1</span>
          <span class="step-text">Open the Uber app. Tap the search bar at the top that says <strong>"Where to?"</strong> Type your destination — the address, or a well-known place like "Windsor Regional Hospital" or "Devonshire Mall."</span>
        </div>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">2</span>
          <span class="step-text"><strong>Choose your ride type.</strong> You will see options like UberX (standard car, most affordable), Uber Comfort (newer, more spacious car), and sometimes Uber XL (larger vehicle). UberX is fine for most trips.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">3</span>
          <span class="step-text"><strong>Review the price.</strong> Uber shows you the upfront cost before you confirm. No surprises — this is the amount that will be charged to your card.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">4</span>
          <span class="step-text">Confirm your pickup location is correct, then tap <strong>"Request UberX"</strong> (or whichever type you chose).</span>
        </div>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">5</span>
          <span class="step-text">Wait 10–60 seconds for a driver to accept. You will then see the driver's name, photo, star rating, car model, colour, and <strong>licence plate number.</strong></span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="visual-example-card" role="img" aria-label="Visual Example: Uber Driver Information Screen">
        <div class="example-icon">🪪</div>
        <div class="example-content">
          <h4 class="example-title">What You See After a Driver Accepts</h4>
          <p class="example-description">The app shows you: Driver's first name and photo, their star rating (e.g., 4.87 ★ from 1,847 trips), the car model and colour (e.g., "Silver Toyota Camry"), and the <strong>licence plate number</strong>. Always check the plate before getting in.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Step 3: Meeting Your Driver — The Most Important Part</h3>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <span class="warning-box-label">Safety First — Always</span>
        <p>Before getting into any vehicle, do these three things in order:</p>
      </div>

      <div class="walkthrough">
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">1</span>
          <span class="step-text"><strong>Check the licence plate FIRST.</strong> Look at the plate on the car approaching you and compare it to the plate shown in the app. They must match exactly.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">2</span>
          <span class="step-text"><strong>Check the car make and colour.</strong> The app tells you "Silver Toyota Camry" — make sure the car in front of you matches.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">3</span>
          <span class="step-text"><strong>Let the driver greet you by YOUR name.</strong> A legitimate Uber driver knows who they are picking up. Wait for them to say "Are you Robert?" — you should NEVER be the first to say the driver's name. This prevents strangers from impersonating your driver.</span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-block">
        <span class="tip-label">The Golden Rule of Ride-Sharing Safety</span>
        <p><strong>If something does not match — if the plate is different, if the driver seems unsure of your name, or if anything feels wrong — do NOT get in the car.</strong> Cancel the trip in the app and request a new one. Your safety is worth a brief delay.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Step 4: During the Ride</h3>

      <ul class="content-list">
        <li><strong>Sit in the back seat</strong> — this is the standard practice and most comfortable</li>
        <li><strong>Wear your seatbelt</strong> — always</li>
        <li><strong>Share your trip:</strong> In the app, tap the shield icon → "Share Status" → select a contact. Your chosen family member or friend can now watch your ride in real-time on their phone</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency button:</strong> If you ever feel unsafe, the app has a 911 button that sends your location and driver details to emergency services</li>
        <li><strong>Trust your instincts:</strong> If you feel uncomfortable at any point, you can ask to be let out at the next safe public place (like a gas station or pharmacy)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 5: Arrival and Payment</h3>

      <div class="walkthrough">
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">1</span>
          <span class="step-text">When you arrive, payment processes <strong>automatically</strong> through the app. You do not need cash or a card — nothing changes hands at all.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">2</span>
          <span class="step-text">You will be asked to rate your driver from 1 to 5 stars. A tip is optional — suggested 15–20% for great service. You can also skip the tip.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">3</span>
          <span class="step-text">A receipt is automatically emailed to you. You can also view all past trips in the app under "Your Trips."</span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>🩷 Lyft — Very Similar to Uber</h2>

      <p>Lyft works almost identically to Uber. The setup, requesting, and safety procedures are the same. A few differences to note:</p>

      <ul class="content-list">
        <li><strong>Logo:</strong> Pink with a stylized "L" — sometimes called the "pink mustache brand"</li>
        <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Sometimes slightly cheaper than Uber, sometimes slightly more — it is worth checking both apps if you have time</li>
        <li><strong>Availability:</strong> In Ontario, Lyft is active in Windsor, London, and Kitchener-Waterloo. Uber tends to have wider coverage in smaller cities like St. Thomas and Woodstock</li>
        <li><strong>Safety features:</strong> Same — GPS tracking, driver photo and plate verification, 911 emergency button, trip sharing</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <span class="tip-box-label">Which App Should I Use?</span>
        <p>Both are safe and reliable. If you are in a larger city, try both and see which has shorter wait times and better prices that day. If you are in a smaller community, start with Uber as it tends to have more drivers in rural Ontario areas.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>🛡️ Safety Deep-Dive</h2>

      <p>Ride-sharing is designed with safety as a priority. Here is a complete summary of your safety checklist:</p>

      <div class="checklist" style="margin-bottom:24px;">
        <label style="display:flex;align-items:flex-start;gap:12px;padding:10px;"><input type="checkbox" style="margin-top:3px;flex-shrink:0;"> <span><strong>Always check the licence plate FIRST</strong> — before the car door, before anything else</span></label>

        <label style="display:flex;align-items:flex-start;gap:12px;padding:10px;"><input type="checkbox" style="margin-top:3px;flex-shrink:0;"> <span><strong>Share your trip</strong> with a family member before every ride</span></label>
        <label style="display:flex;align-items:flex-start;gap:12px;padding:10px;"><input type="checkbox" style="margin-top:3px;flex-shrink:0;"> <span><strong>Trust your instincts</strong> — if something feels wrong, end the ride</span></label>
      </div>

      <div class="confidence-check">
        <span class="check-icon">💛</span>
        <p>Confidence Check: These safety habits take about 30 seconds total and make every ride safer. With time, they become completely automatic.</p>

      <h2>Practical Exercise: Set Up Without Requesting</h2>

      <div class="exercise-block">
        <h3>Your Practice This Week</h3>
        <p>Set up the Uber app and get comfortable with how it works — without actually requesting a ride yet.</p>
        <ol class="numbered-list">
          <li>Download Uber from the App Store or Google Play Store.</li>
          <li>Create your account (phone number, email, name).</li>
          <li>Add a payment method — a credit or debit card.</li>
          <li>Open the app and type in a local destination — your doctor's office, a friend's address, or the nearest mall.</li>
          <li>Look at the ride options and the price shown. Notice how clearly the cost is displayed.</li>
          <li><strong>Do NOT tap "Request" yet</strong> — just explore the app and see how it feels.</li>
          <li>Optional: Ask a family member to try a short test trip with you as a "passenger practice run."</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="success-state">
          <strong>Success looks like this:</strong> You have the app installed, an account set up, and you understand how to request a ride and what information you would see about your driver.
