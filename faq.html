Always use your bank's official app or type their web address yourself (for example, rbc.com). Never follow links from emails claiming to be your bank.

An iPad is a larger tablet — about the size of a small book — that connects to Wi-Fi and is ideal for reading, watching videos, and video calls. Both run the same apps and work very similarly, so the skills you learn on one apply to the other."

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Press the <strong>Home button</strong> — the round button below the screen on older devices — or <strong>swipe up from the very bottom</strong> of the screen on newer iPads and iPhones. This always takes you safely back to your home screen, no matter what happened.</p>
          <p>You can never break anything by pressing the Home button. It is always safe to use.</p>

        <summary>How can I tell if an email is a scam?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Watch for these warning signs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Urgent language</strong> — "Act now!", "Your account will be closed!", "You have won!"</li>
            <li><strong>Suspicious sender address</strong> — For example, apple-support-help@gmail.com instead of @apple.com</li>
            <li><strong>Requests for your password or banking information</strong> — No legitimate company ever asks for this by email</li>
            <li><strong>Links that look odd</strong> — Hover over a link (on a computer) to see where it really goes</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>When in doubt, delete it.</strong> Contact the company directly by phone using a number you find yourself — never use a number from the suspicious email.</p>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is online banking safe for seniors?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes — online banking through your bank's <strong>official app</strong> is very safe. Download the app from the App Store or Google Play Store (search for your bank's name). Always access your bank by typing their address yourself (for example, <em>rbc.com</em>) — never follow links from emails.</p>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What is the difference between an iPhone and an iPad?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>An <strong>iPhone</strong> is a phone that fits in your pocket. It can make calls, send texts, and connect to the internet. An <strong>iPad</strong> is a larger tablet — about the size of a small book — that connects to Wi-Fi and is ideal for reading, watching videos, and video calls. It does not make phone calls on its own.</p>
          <p>Both run the same apps and work very similarly. Skills you learn on one apply to the other.</p>

      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How do I download apps safely?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Only download apps from:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>App Store</strong> — for iPhone and iPad (blue icon with white A)</li>
            <li><strong>Google Play Store</strong> — for Android phones and tablets</li>
            <li><strong>Microsoft Store</strong> — for Windows computers</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Before downloading, check: Does it have thousands of reviews? Is the developer name recognisable? Was it updated recently? If something feels off, do not download it. Never install apps from websites, pop-up ads, or links sent by email or text.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What should I do if I think I have been scammed?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p><strong>Do not panic — you are not alone, and help is available.</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Stop all contact with the scammer immediately</li>
            <li>If money was involved, call your bank right away — they can often stop or reverse transactions</li>
            <li>Report to the <strong>Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre: <a href="tel:18884958501">1-888-495-8501</a></strong></li>

            <li>Tell a trusted family member or friend</li>

          <p>Reporting helps protect others. You will not get in trouble for reporting.</p>
        </div>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How do I make text larger on my iPhone or iPad?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Go to <strong>Settings → Display &amp; Brightness → Text Size</strong> and drag the slider to the right. For even larger text, go to <strong>Settings → Accessibility → Display &amp; Text Size → Larger Text</strong>.</p>
          <p>On this website, use the <strong>A buttons at the top</strong> of the page — tap the larger A to increase text size. Your preference is saved for your next visit.</p>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Where can I get in-person technology help in Ontario?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Several free options are available across Ontario:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Your local public library</strong> — most offer free tech help sessions and workshops</li>
            <li><strong>Connected Canadians</strong> — free one-on-one help by phone: <a href="tel:18558080505">1-855-808-0505</a></li>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Do I need antivirus software on my iPhone or iPad?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Generally, <strong>no</strong>. iPhones and iPads have very strong built-in security and do not need antivirus apps. The most important protections are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Keep your operating system updated: <strong>Settings → General → Software Update</strong></li>
            <li>Only download apps from the official App Store</li>
            <li>Avoid clicking suspicious links</li>
          </ul>
          <p>On <strong>Android</strong>, built-in Google Play Protect scans apps automatically. On <strong>Windows computers</strong>, Microsoft Defender (built in) provides good protection and does not require a subscription.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What is two-factor authentication and do I need it?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an <strong>extra security step</strong>. After entering your password, you receive a short code by text message to confirm it is really you — like a second lock on the door.</p>
          <p><strong>Yes, you should enable it</strong> on your email, banking, and social media accounts. It prevents thieves from accessing your accounts even if they somehow learn your password. Your bank and email provider will have a "Security" section in their settings where you can turn this on.</p>
