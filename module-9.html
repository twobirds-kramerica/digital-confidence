      <h1>Module 9: Understanding AI — What You Need to Know</h1>
      <p><strong>What you will learn:</strong> What artificial intelligence really is, how to spot AI-powered scams and deepfakes, how to protect your privacy, and how to try a few safe AI tools that can make your life easier.</p>

      <div class="story-block">
        <span class="story-label">Margaret's AI Encounter</span>
        <p>Margaret, 72, from {{CITY}}, was scrolling through Facebook when she spotted a photo of her friend Helen at what looked like a glamorous tropical resort. "Helen never mentioned going on a trip!" she thought. When Margaret called to congratulate her, Helen laughed — she had never been to a resort in her life. The photo had been created by an AI app that someone had used to make a fun fantasy image.</p>
        <p>But that got Margaret wondering: if AI could make a photo that convincing, what else could it do? Could someone make a fake photo of her? Could they make a fake video? How could she tell what was real?</p>
        <p>Margaret decided to learn about AI before she had to deal with it in a stressful situation. By the end of her research, she was not scared — she was actually excited. She had tried using AI to help plan her garden and found it surprisingly helpful.</p>
        <p>That is the goal of this module: to give you the same calm, informed understanding that Margaret found.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>🤖 What Is AI? (In Plain Language)</h2>

      <div class="tip-block">
        <span class="tip-label">The Simple Version</span>
        <p>Think of AI as a <strong>very smart autocomplete</strong> — like your phone's keyboard suggestions, but one that has learned from reading millions of books, websites, and conversations. When you ask it a question, it predicts the most helpful response based on everything it has learned.</p>
      </div>

      <p>You have already been using AI for years without knowing it:</p>

      <ul class="content-list">
        <li><strong>Siri and Google Assistant</strong> — voice assistants on your phone that understand spoken questions</li>
        <li><strong>Autocorrect</strong> — suggests the right spelling as you type</li>
        <li><strong>Photo sorting</strong> — your Photos app can group pictures by faces automatically</li>
        <li><strong>Spam filters</strong> — your email moves junk mail to a Spam folder without you asking</li>
        <li><strong>Netflix / YouTube recommendations</strong> — suggests videos and shows you might like</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="visual-example-card" role="img" aria-label="Visual Example: AI in Everyday Life">
        <div class="example-icon">🔮</div>
        <div class="example-content">
          <h4 class="example-title">AI Is Already Part of Your Day</h4>
          <p class="example-description">Every time your phone corrects a typo, suggests a contact name, or unlocks with your face, that is AI at work. It is a tool — not magic, not a robot, not something to fear.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p><strong>What AI is NOT:</strong> Science fiction robots, a sentient being with feelings or plans, something that "knows" you personally, or something magical. It is a tool — like a very sophisticated calculator or dictionary.</p>

      <div class="confidence-check">
        <span class="check-icon">💛</span>
        <p>Confidence Check: You have already been using AI successfully for years. This is just learning the name for something familiar.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>😨 Should I Be Scared of AI?</h2>

      <p>Short answer: <strong>No.</strong> But being informed and careful is always smart with any technology.</p>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <span class="tip-box-label">Good Analogy</span>
        <p>AI is a tool, like a car. A car can be used to take you safely to the grocery store, or — in the wrong hands — it can cause harm. The car itself is not good or evil. The same is true of AI.</p>
      </div>

      <p>The real concern with AI is not the technology itself — it is <strong>people who misuse it</strong>. Just as scammers use phones and email to trick people, some scammers now use AI to make their tricks more convincing. The good news: the same common sense that protects you from regular scams protects you from AI-powered scams too.</p>

      <h2>🚨 What to Watch Out For</h2>

      <h3>Deepfake Videos and Audio</h3>
      <p>AI can create realistic fake videos of real people saying things they never actually said. These are called <strong>deepfakes</strong>.</p>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <span class="warning-box-label">Watch Out</span>
        <p><strong>Deepfakes are often used for:</strong> political misinformation, celebrity scams pretending a famous person recommends an investment, and — most dangerously — impersonating family members to ask for money.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>How to spot a deepfake video:</strong></p>
      <ul class="content-list">
        <li>Unnatural or limited blinking — real people blink naturally and often</li>
        <li>Lip sync slightly off — the mouth does not quite match the words</li>
        <li>Weird lighting on the face compared to the background</li>
        <li>Slightly blurry edges around the face or hairline</li>
        <li>The person seems stiff or robotic compared to how they normally move</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="three-second-rule">
        <h3>The 3-Second Rule for Shocking Content</h3>
        <div class="steps">
          <div class="step">
            <span class="step-icon">✋</span>
            <span class="step-name">Stop</span>
            <span class="step-desc">Pause before reacting or sharing.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="step">
            <span class="step-icon">🫁</span>
            <span class="step-name">Breathe</span>
            <span class="step-desc">Emotional content is designed to skip your judgment.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="step">
            <span class="step-icon">🔍</span>
            <span class="step-name">Verify</span>
            <span class="step-desc">Check a reputable news source before believing it.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>AI-Generated Scam Emails</h3>
      <p>Scammers now use AI to write more convincing phishing emails. The grammar is better, the tone sounds more human, and the spelling is correct. But the red flags remain the same:</p>
      <ul class="content-list">
        <li>Urgency — "Act immediately or your account will be closed"</li>
        <li>Requests for money, gift cards, or personal information</li>
        <li>Unknown or suspicious sender address</li>
        <li>Links that do not match the company they claim to be from</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Apply the same security rules you learned in <a href="module-2.html">Module 2: The Security Shield</a>. AI makes scam emails look better, but it cannot change their fundamental tactics.</p>

      <h3>Fake AI-Generated Photos</h3>
      <p>AI can create realistic photos of events that never happened — politicians "saying" things they never said, fake product reviews with AI-generated happy customers, and news stories that are entirely fabricated.</p>

      <div class="tip-block">
        <span class="tip-label">Quick Check</span>
        <p>If a photo seems shocking or unbelievable, ask: <strong>"Does this appear on any reputable news sites like CBC, CTV, or the Toronto Star?"</strong> If only unknown websites are sharing it, be very skeptical.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Voice Cloning — The Grandparent Scam 2.0</h3>
      <p>This is the most important AI scam for seniors to know about. Scammers can now clone a loved one's voice using just a few seconds of audio from social media.</p>

      <div class="scam-example">
        <span class="example-label">Example of a voice cloning scam (this type of call is NOT real)</span>
        <p>"Grandma? It's me, Tyler. I'm in trouble — I got in a car accident and I need bail money right away. Please don't tell Mom and Dad. Can you send $2,000 through an e-transfer?"</p>
      </div>

      <p>The voice sounds exactly like your grandchild. Your heart races. But here is how to protect yourself:</p>

      <div class="tip-block">
        <span class="tip-label">Your Family Safe Word</span>
        <p>Create a secret code word with your family right now. If anyone calls claiming to be a family member in trouble, ask for the code word. A real family member will know it. A scammer will not.</p>
        <p>Also: <strong>hang up and call the person back</strong> on their known phone number. If your grandchild truly needs help, they will answer — or a parent will confirm the story.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>🔒 Privacy Concerns with AI Tools</h2>

      <h3>What Not to Share with AI Chatbots</h3>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <span class="warning-box-label">Protect Your Privacy</span>
        <p>When using AI chat tools like ChatGPT, <strong>never share:</strong> your Social Insurance Number, banking information, passwords, home address, medical details, or any other personal information. Your conversations may be saved and used to improve the AI system.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Safe to share with AI:</strong> General questions, recipe ideas, how-to instructions, help writing a thank-you note, questions about history or science. Think of it like asking a knowledgeable stranger at a library — helpful for general questions, but no personal details.</p>

      <h3>Companies May Save Your Data</h3>
      <p>Free AI services often keep your questions and answers. Photos you upload might be stored on their servers. When in doubt, look for "privacy mode" or "incognito" settings in AI tools, or choose Canadian-based services that follow PIPEDA privacy law.</p>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <span class="tip-box-label">Good News</span>
        <p>Your iPad or iPhone's built-in AI features — like photo enhancement and Face ID — process everything <strong>on your device only</strong>. Apple does not see your photos or your face. That data never leaves your device.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>✨ Beginner-Friendly AI Tools to Try</h2>

      <p>Here are three safe, easy AI tools you can try today. Start with just one — there is no rush.</p>

      <div class="exercise-block">
        <h3>📸 1. iPhone/iPad Photo Enhancement (Built-in, 100% Safe)</h3>
        <p>Your Photos app uses AI to automatically improve your pictures. All processing happens on your device — Apple does not see your photos.</p>
        <ol class="numbered-list">
          <li>Open the <strong>Photos</strong> app on your iPad or iPhone.</li>
          <li>Tap on any photo — try an old family photo or a dim one taken indoors.</li>
          <li>Tap <strong>Edit</strong> (top right corner).</li>
          <li>Tap the <strong>magic wand icon</strong> (✨ a small sparkle shape) — this is the Auto Enhance button.</li>
          <li>Watch the photo improve instantly! You can compare by tapping the wand again to toggle.</li>
          <li>Tap <strong>Done</strong> to save the improved version. Your original is never lost.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="exercise-block">
        <h3>🔍 2. Google Lens (Identify Objects, Read Text)</h3>
        <p>Google Lens lets you point your camera at almost anything and get information about it.</p>
        <ol class="numbered-list">
          <li>Open the <strong>Google app</strong> or <strong>Google Photos</strong> on your device.</li>
          <li>Look for the Lens icon — it looks like a small colourful camera viewfinder.</li>
          <li><strong>Try it on a plant:</strong> Point at any plant in your home or garden. Google tells you what type of plant it is.</li>
          <li><strong>Try it on text:</strong> Point at a label, sign, or even a printed menu in another language — Google translates it instantly.</li>
          <li><strong>Try it on food:</strong> Point at a dish you do not recognize and Google identifies it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It is free and requires no account login.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="exercise-block">
        <h3>💬 3. ChatGPT for Everyday Help (Free Version)</h3>
        <p>ChatGPT is an AI you can have a conversation with. Think of it as a very patient, knowledgeable helper.</p>
        <div class="tip-box">
          <span class="tip-box-label">Before You Start</span>
          <p>Remember: never share personal information. Use it for general questions only.</p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Ideas for what to ask:</strong></p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>"Give me a recipe idea using chicken, potatoes, and carrots"</li>
          <li>"Help me write a thank-you note to my neighbour who brought me soup"</li>
          <li>"Explain what a TFSA is in simple language"</li>
          <li>"What are five easy exercises for seniors with knee pain?"</li>
          <li>"What should I look for when buying a new toaster?"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To access: visit <strong>chat.openai.com</strong> (a free account is needed — use your email address to sign up). No payment information required for the free version.</p>

      <h2>Practical Exercise: Try One Safe AI Tool</h2>

      <div class="exercise-block">
        <h3>Your Challenge This Week</h3>
        <p>Choose just ONE of the three tools above and try it for five minutes with something low-stakes — enhance a family photo, identify a plant, or ask for a recipe idea.</p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>Notice how it feels: exciting? Surprising? A bit confusing?</li>
          <li>All of those reactions are completely normal and valid.</li>
          <li>There is no wrong way to explore.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="success-state">
          <strong>Success looks like this:</strong> You tried one AI tool, you were not overwhelmed, and you walked away with one useful result — even if it was just seeing your photo look better with the tap of a button.
