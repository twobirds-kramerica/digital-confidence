      <h1>Module 4: App Store Safety</h1>
      <p><strong>What you will learn:</strong> How to find, download, and verify apps safely. You will learn to spot fake apps, understand what permissions mean, and keep your device running smoothly.</p>

        <span class="story-label">Frank's Story</span>
        <p>Frank, 76, from Amherstburg, wanted to download a weather app for his iPad. His friend had recommended one, so Frank opened what he thought was the App Store and searched for "weather." He found an app that looked right, tapped "Get," and was immediately asked for his credit card number. Frank entered it, thinking this was normal.</p>
        <p>Two weeks later, Frank noticed a $49.99 charge on his credit card from a company he had never heard of. It turned out he had downloaded a fake weather app that signed him up for a weekly subscription. The "App Store" he had used was actually a website pretending to be the App Store.</p>
        <p>Frank's mistake was understandable — the fake store looked very real. But there are clear ways to make sure you are using the real App Store, downloading real apps, and never getting tricked by hidden fees. That is what this module is all about.</p>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <span class="tip-box-label">Tip</span>
        <p>The safest way to open the App Store is to tap its icon directly on your Home screen — never from a link in an email, text message, or website.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Real App Store: How to Find It</h2>

      <div class="device-content" data-devices="iphone,ipad">
      <p>The App Store is the only safe place to download apps on your iPad or iPhone. It is run by Apple, and every app in it has been reviewed for safety. Here is how to find the real one:</p>

        <span class="warning-label">Important</span>
        <p>Never download apps from a website, a link in an email, or a link in a text message. Only use the official app store on your device. If someone sends you a link to download an app, ignore it — find the app yourself in the real App Store or Play Store.</p>

        <p class="check-subtext">Everything that follows builds on this foundation.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>How to Spot a Real App vs. a Fake App</h2>

      <p>When you search the App Store, you might see several apps with similar names. Here is how to pick the real one:</p>

      <ul class="content-list">
        <li><strong>Check the developer name.</strong> The developer's name appears below the app name in small text. For example, the real "RBC Mobile" app is made by "Royal Bank of Canada." If the developer name looks unfamiliar or is misspelled, be cautious.</li>
        <li><strong>Look at the number of ratings.</strong> Popular, legitimate apps have thousands or millions of ratings. A fake copycat might have very few — perhaps dozens or even none.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="image-placeholder" role="img" aria-label="App Store listing showing developer name and download count">
        <div class="placeholder-inner">
          <div class="placeholder-icon-wrap">📱</div>
          <div class="placeholder-text-wrap">
            <span class="placeholder-label">Screenshot needed</span>
            <p class="placeholder-caption">App Store listing showing developer name and download count</p>
            <p class="placeholder-dims">Recommended: 600 × 800 px</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <ul class="content-list">
        <li><strong>Read the star rating.</strong> Most real apps from established companies have ratings of 3.5 stars or above (out of 5). Very low ratings (below 2 stars) are a warning sign.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the screenshots.</strong> Scroll down to see pictures of what the app looks like. Do they look professional? Do they match what you would expect?</li>
        <li><strong>Look for the "In-App Purchases" label.</strong> If an app says "In-App Purchases" below the "Get" button, that means the app is free to download but may ask you to pay for extra features inside the app. This is not always bad, but be aware of it.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="three-second-rule">
        <h3>The 3-Second Rule for Apps</h3>
        <div class="steps">
          <div class="step">
            <span class="step-icon">✋</span>
            <span class="step-name">Stop</span>

            <span class="step-desc">Check the developer, ratings, and reviews. Does everything look right?</span>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <span class="warning-box-label">Watch Out</span>
        <p>If an app has very few ratings, a developer name you do not recognise, or screenshots that look sloppy, do not download it. A legitimate app from a major company will always have thousands of ratings.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="three-second-rule-box">
        <h4>Remember the 3-Second Rule</h4>
        <p>Stop. Breathe. Think before you tap. If something feels urgent or too good to be true, that is your signal to pause.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Understanding App Permissions</h2>

      <p>When you first open a new app, it might ask for permission to access parts of your iPad. These requests appear as small pop-up boxes. Here is what the common ones mean:</p>

      <ul class="content-list">
        <li><strong>"[App Name] Would Like to Send You Notifications"</strong> — This means the app wants to send you alerts and reminders, even when you are not using it. Tap <strong>"Allow"</strong> if you want reminders (like a weather alert) or <strong>"Don't Allow"</strong> if you do not want to be bothered.</li>
        <li><strong>"[App Name] Would Like to Access Your Location"</strong> — The app wants to know where you are. A weather or maps app needs this to work properly. A game or flashlight app does not. Choose "While Using the App" for apps that genuinely need your location, and "Don't Allow" for apps that do not.</li>
        <li><strong>"[App Name] Would Like to Access Your Photos"</strong> — The app wants to see pictures stored on your iPad. A photo editing app needs this; a calculator app does not.</li>
        <li><strong>"[App Name] Would Like to Access Your Contacts"</strong> — The app wants to see your address book. Only allow this for communication apps like FaceTime or Messages.</li>
        <li><strong>"[App Name] Would Like to Track Your Activity"</strong> — The app wants to follow what you do on other apps and websites to show you targeted advertisements. Almost always, tap <strong>"Ask App Not to Track."</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <div class="image-placeholder" role="img" aria-label="App permission request popup — Allow or Don't Allow">
        <div class="placeholder-inner">
          <div class="placeholder-icon-wrap">❓</div>

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-block">
        <span class="tip-label">The Simple Rule</span>
        <p>If you are not sure, choose <strong>"Don't Allow."</strong> You can always change your mind later in Settings. Saying "no" never breaks an app — at worst, one feature might not work, and the app will tell you.</p>

        <p>When in doubt about a permission, choose "Don't Allow." You can always change your mind later in Settings, and saying no never breaks an app.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Subscriptions and Hidden Costs</h2>

      <p>Some apps are free to download but charge a monthly or yearly fee to keep using them. This is called a <strong>subscription</strong>. It is like a magazine subscription — you pay regularly to keep getting it.</p>

      <p>Subscriptions are not necessarily bad, but you should always know what you are signing up for. Here is how to check:</p>

      <div class="walkthrough">
        <h4>Checking Your Subscriptions</h4>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">1</span>

          <span class="step-text">You will see a list of all active subscriptions. If you see something you do not recognise or no longer want, tap it and choose <strong>"Cancel Subscription."</strong></span>
        </div>
      </div>

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="warning-block">
        <span class="warning-label">Watch Out For</span>
        <p>Some apps offer a "free trial" that automatically converts to a paid subscription after 3 or 7 days. If you try a free trial, set a reminder on your phone to cancel before the trial ends — or cancel immediately after signing up (you will still get the full trial period, but it will not charge you afterward).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <span class="warning-box-label">Watch Out</span>
        <p>Some "free trial" apps will charge you automatically after a few days. If you sign up for a free trial, set a reminder to cancel before the trial ends — or cancel right away (you still get the full trial period).</p>

        <h3>Practical Exercise: App Store Explorer</h3>
        <ol class="numbered-list">
          <li>Open the App Store and search for <strong>"The Weather Network."</strong> Check the developer name, star rating, and number of reviews. Do not download it — this is practice.</li>
          <li>Go to Settings → [Your Name] → Subscriptions and check if you have any active subscriptions you did not know about.</li>
          <li>If you have any apps on your Home screen that you do not recognise or no longer use, practise deleting one.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="success-state">
          <strong>Success looks like this:</strong> You can confidently search for an app, verify it is legitimate by checking the developer and ratings, and you know where to find and cancel subscriptions.
