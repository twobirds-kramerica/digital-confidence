      <h1>Module 1: Mastering the Escape Hatch</h1>
      <p><strong>What you will learn:</strong> The single most important skill in using any device — how to get back to safety, no matter what happens on your screen.</p>

      <div class="story-block">
        <span class="story-label">Margaret's Story</span>
        <p>Margaret, 74, from Windsor, was browsing recipes on her iPad one Tuesday morning. She tapped on a link that promised the "Best Butter Tart Recipe in Ontario," and suddenly her screen was filled with flashing colours and a loud voice saying her iPad had a virus. Her heart raced. She could not find a way to close it. She thought her iPad was broken — or worse, that someone was stealing her banking information right that second.</p>
        <p>Margaret did what many of us would do: she panicked. She pressed every button she could find. Nothing seemed to work. Finally, she unplugged her iPad and hid it in a drawer for three days.</p>
        <p>Here is the good news: Margaret's iPad was perfectly fine the entire time. That scary message was a fake — a common trick designed to frighten people. And if Margaret had known the one skill we are about to learn, she could have closed that fake warning in about two seconds and gone right back to her butter tart recipe.</p>
        <p>That skill is what we call <strong>the Escape Hatch</strong>, and it is the most important thing you will learn in this entire course.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Golden Rule: Nothing Is Permanent</h2>

      <p>Before we learn any buttons or gestures, let us start with the most comforting truth about your iPad and iPhone:</p>

      <div class="tip-block">
        <span class="tip-label">The Golden Rule</span>
        <p><strong>You cannot break your iPad by tapping the wrong thing.</strong> You cannot accidentally delete the internet. You cannot "ruin" your device by opening the wrong app. Almost everything you do on your iPad can be undone, closed, or fixed.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Think of your iPad like a library. When you open an app, it is like picking a book off the shelf. When you close the app, you are putting the book back. The book is still there. The library is still there. You have not changed anything permanent.</p>

      <p>Even if you accidentally delete an app, you can get it back. Even if you type something in the wrong place, you can erase it. Even if a strange website pops up on your screen, you can close it. Your iPad is remarkably forgiving.</p>

      <h2>Your Escape Hatches: Three Ways to Get Back to Safety</h2>

      <h3>Escape Hatch Number 1: The Home Button (or Home Gesture)</h3>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <span class="tip-box-label">Tip</span>
        <p>The Home button is your best friend. No matter how lost or confused you feel, pressing it always takes you back to familiar ground. You cannot break anything by pressing it, so press it as often as you like.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Your device has one primary escape route, and it depends on which device you have:</p>

      <div class="device-content" data-devices="iphone,ipad">
      <p>Here is how it works on your iPad or iPhone:</p>

      <div class="walkthrough">
        <h4>If your iPad has a round button at the bottom of the screen:</h4>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">1</span>
          <span class="step-text">Look at the very bottom edge of your iPad, below the screen. You will see a round, slightly indented circle. That is your <strong>Home button</strong>.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">2</span>
          <span class="step-text">Press it once with your thumb or finger. Not hard — a gentle, firm press.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">3</span>
          <span class="step-text">Whatever was on your screen disappears. You are back at your Home screen — the screen with all your little app pictures on it.</span>

        </div>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">2</span>

      <div class="tip-block">
        <span class="tip-label">Android Bonus: The Back Button</span>
        <p>Android has an extra escape route that Apple devices do not have — the <strong>Back button</strong>. It is the triangle shape at the bottom left of your screen (or you can swipe inward from the left or right edge of the screen on newer devices). Tapping Back takes you one step backward, like retracing your steps. If the Home button is like teleporting home, the Back button is like walking back the way you came.</p>
      </div>
      </div>

      <p><strong>This is your primary Escape Hatch.</strong> No matter what is happening on your screen — a scary pop-up, a confusing website, an app you did not mean to open — pressing the Home button or swiping up from the bottom takes you back to familiar ground.</p>

      <div class="confidence-check">
        <span class="check-icon">💛</span>
        <p>Confidence Check: You are doing wonderfully. The Home button is your best friend on this device.</p>
        <p class="check-text">Try pressing it right now. Go ahead — you will come right back to this page when you open your web browser again.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Escape Hatch Number 2: Force Quitting an App</h3>

      <p>Sometimes — and this is rare — an app might freeze or stop responding. The screen might not change when you tap, or an app might seem "stuck." This is not dangerous, and it does not mean anything is wrong with your device. Apps, like people, occasionally need a fresh start.</p>

      <div class="tip-block">
        <span class="tip-label">Helpful Hint</span>
        <p>Some Android devices also show a <strong>"Close All"</strong> button at the bottom of the recent apps screen. Tapping this closes every open app at once — a handy way to give your device a fresh start if things feel sluggish.</p>
      </div>
      </div>

      <p>Think of force quitting like hanging up the phone and calling back. You are not losing anything — you are giving the app a fresh start.</p>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <span class="tip-box-label">Tip</span>
        <p>You do not need to force quit your apps every day. Only use force quit when an app is stuck or misbehaving. The rest of the time, simply pressing the Home button is enough.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="confidence-check-box">
        <span class="check-icon">💪</span>
        <p>You have already learned two escape routes. That is brilliant progress for one sitting.</p>
        <p class="check-subtext">Take a moment to appreciate how far you have come. These skills will serve you every single day.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Escape Hatch Number 3: Restarting Your Device</h3>

      <p>If things are really not working — the screen is frozen and even the Home button is not responding — you can restart your device. This is like turning a light switch off and on. It fixes most problems and does not erase anything.</p>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <span class="tip-box-label">Tip</span>
        <p>Restarting your device is like giving it a good night's sleep. It clears out any small problems and helps things run smoothly. If your device ever feels sluggish, a restart often does the trick.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <span class="warning-box-label">Watch Out</span>
        <p>If a pop-up message tells you to call a phone number or press a button to "fix" your device, do not follow those instructions. Instead, use your Escape Hatch. Real problems are never fixed by calling a number on your screen.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>What About Those Scary Pop-Up Messages?</h2>

      <p>Let us talk about the situation that frightened Margaret. You are browsing the web or using an app, and suddenly a message fills your screen:</p>

      <div class="scam-example">
        <span class="example-label">Example of a fake warning (this is NOT real)</span>
        <p>WARNING! Your iPad has been infected with 3 viruses! Your personal data is at risk! Call Apple Support immediately at 1-888-555-0199 to protect your device! Do NOT close this window!</p>
      </div>

      <p>This message is <strong>fake</strong>. Every single time. Here is how you can be certain:</p>

      <ul class="red-flags">
        <li>Apple will never send you a pop-up warning about viruses while you browse the web.</li>
        <li>Real warnings from your iPad appear as small, calm notifications — not flashing, full-screen alarms.</li>
        <li>Any message that tells you to call a phone number is a scam. Always.</li>
        <li>Any message that tells you "Do NOT close this window" is specifically designed to keep you from using your Escape Hatch. Close it immediately.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="three-second-rule">
        <h3>The 3-Second Rule</h3>
        <div class="steps">
          <div class="step">
            <span class="step-icon">✋</span>
            <span class="step-name">Stop</span>
            <span class="step-desc">Take your fingers off the screen.</span>

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>After your 3-Second Rule pause, use your Escape Hatch. Press the Home button. The scary message is gone. Your iPad is fine. Go make yourself a cup of tea — you handled it perfectly.</p>

      <h2>Understanding Your Home Screen</h2>

      <p>Now that you know how to get back to the Home screen, let us take a moment to understand what you are looking at when you get there.</p>

      <p>Your Home screen is like the top of a well-organised desk. Each little square picture — called an <strong>icon</strong> — is a doorway into a different app. Here are the icons you will see most often:</p>

      <div class="device-content" data-devices="iphone,ipad">
      <ul class="content-list">
        <li><strong>Safari</strong> — looks like a blue compass. This is your web browser, the app you use to visit websites.</li>
        <li><strong>Mail</strong> — looks like a white envelope on a blue background. This is where your email lives.</li>
        <li><strong>Messages</strong> — looks like a green speech bubble. This is for text messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Photos</strong> — looks like a colourful flower shape. All your pictures are stored here.</li>
        <li><strong>Settings</strong> — looks like grey mechanical gears. This is where you adjust how your iPad works.</li>
        <li><strong>App Store</strong> — looks like a blue icon with a white letter "A" made of sticks. This is where you get new apps.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>At the very bottom of your screen, you will notice a row of icons that stays the same no matter which Home screen page you are on. This is called the <strong>Dock</strong>. Think of it as your "favourites shelf" — the apps you use most often.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="device-content" data-devices="android-phone,android-tablet">
      <ul class="content-list">
        <li><strong>Chrome</strong> — looks like a colourful circle (red, yellow, green, and blue). This is your web browser, the app you use to visit websites. Some devices may also have <strong>Samsung Internet</strong> (a purple and white globe icon).</li>
        <li><strong>Gmail</strong> — looks like a colourful letter "M" on a white background. This is where your email lives.</li>
        <li><strong>Messages</strong> — looks like a blue speech bubble with three dots. This is for text messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Photos</strong> — looks like a colourful pinwheel shape (Google Photos). All your pictures are stored here.</li>
        <li><strong>Settings</strong> — looks like a gear or cog shape (often grey or blue). This is where you adjust how your device works.</li>
        <li><strong>Play Store</strong> — looks like a colourful triangle (play button). This is where you get new apps.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>At the very bottom of your screen, you will notice a row of icons that stays the same no matter which Home screen page you are on. This is called the <strong>Dock</strong> or <strong>Favourites Tray</strong>. Think of it as your "favourites shelf" — the apps you use most often. You can also pull up from the bottom of the Home screen to see your <strong>App Drawer</strong>, which shows every app on your device in alphabetical order.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="confidence-check">
        <span class="check-icon">💛</span>
        <p>Confidence Check: You are learning the geography of your iPad. Soon, navigating will feel as natural as walking through your own home.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <span class="warning-box-label">Watch Out</span>
        <p>Never call a phone number shown on a pop-up message, even if it says "Apple Support" or "Google Support." Real support teams do not send messages to your screen asking you to ring them.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="confidence-check-box">
        <span class="check-icon">🌟</span>
        <p>You now know how to handle those frightening pop-ups. That is a skill many people never learn.</p>
        <p class="check-subtext">You are already more prepared than most. Keep going — you are doing wonderfully.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Tapping, Swiping, and Other Finger Moves</h2>

      <p>Your iPad responds to how you touch it. Here are the four touches you will use most:</p>

      <div class="walkthrough">
        <h4>The Four Essential Touches</h4>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">1</span>
          <span class="step-text"><strong>Tap:</strong> Quickly touch the screen once with your finger and lift it. This is like clicking a mouse. Use this to open apps, select items, and press buttons.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">2</span>
          <span class="step-text"><strong>Swipe:</strong> Place your finger on the screen and slide it in a direction. Swipe left or right to move between pages. Swipe up or down to scroll through a long page (like this one).</span>
        </div>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">3</span>
          <span class="step-text"><strong>Press and Hold:</strong> Touch the screen and keep your finger there for two seconds. This often opens a menu of extra options, like a right-click on a computer.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="walkthrough-step">
          <span class="step-num">4</span>
          <span class="step-text"><strong>Pinch:</strong> Place two fingers on the screen and move them apart (to zoom in, making things bigger) or together (to zoom out, making things smaller). Very handy for reading small text on websites.</span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-block">
        <span class="tip-label">Helpful Hint</span>
        <p>If you accidentally zoom in too far and the screen looks strange, try the <strong>double-tap</strong> trick: quickly tap the screen twice with one finger. This usually resets the zoom back to normal.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <span class="tip-box-label">Tip</span>
        <p>If the screen does not respond to your tap, make sure you are using the pad of your fingertip, not your fingernail. The screen responds to the warmth and touch of your skin, not to pressure.</p>

        <h3>Practical Exercise: The Escape Hatch Drill</h3>
        <p>Let us practise what you have learned. This exercise has zero risk — you cannot break anything, and you can repeat it as many times as you like.</p>

        <div class="device-content" data-devices="iphone,ipad">
        <ol class="numbered-list">
          <li>Open the <strong>Safari</strong> app by tapping the blue compass icon on your Home screen.</li>
          <li>Visit any website by tapping the long white bar at the top of the screen, typing <strong>weather.gc.ca</strong> and pressing the blue "Go" button on your keyboard.</li>
          <li>Now practise your Escape Hatch: press the Home button (or swipe up from the bottom). You are back at the Home screen. The website is not gone — it is waiting for you in Safari whenever you want to go back.</li>
          <li>Now open Safari again by tapping the blue compass. See? Your weather website is still there, right where you left it.</li>
          <li>Now practise <strong>force quitting</strong>: double-press the Home button (or swipe up and pause). Find the Safari card. Swipe it upward to close it.</li>
          <li>Open Safari one more time. Notice that it starts fresh — and that is perfectly fine.</li>
        </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="device-content" data-devices="android-phone,android-tablet">
        <ol class="numbered-list">
          <li>Open the <strong>Chrome</strong> app by tapping the colourful circle icon on your Home screen (or find it in your App Drawer).</li>
          <li>Visit any website by tapping the long white bar at the top of the screen, typing <strong>weather.gc.ca</strong> and pressing "Go" or the arrow on your keyboard.</li>
          <li>Now practise your Escape Hatch: tap the Home button (the circle at the bottom) or swipe up from the bottom. You are back at the Home screen. The website is not gone — it is waiting for you in Chrome whenever you want to go back.</li>
          <li>Now open Chrome again by tapping its icon. See? Your weather website is still there, right where you left it.</li>
          <li>Now practise <strong>force quitting</strong>: tap the square Recent Apps button (or swipe up and hold). Find the Chrome card. Swipe it away to close it.</li>
          <li>Open Chrome one more time. Notice that it starts fresh — and that is perfectly fine.</li>
        </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="success-state">
          <strong>Success looks like this:</strong> You can comfortably press the Home button to leave any app, and you can force-quit a stuck app without feeling anxious. You understand that closing an app does not delete it.
