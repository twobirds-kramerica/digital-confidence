        <span class="story-label">Dorothy's Story</span>
        <p>Dorothy, 72, lives in {{NEIGHBORHOOD}}. One morning, she received a phone call from someone who said they were from the Canada Revenue Agency (the CRA — that is the government office that handles taxes). The caller said Dorothy owed $4,200 in unpaid taxes and that the police would come to her home within two hours unless she paid immediately using iTunes gift cards.</p>
        <p>Dorothy's heart was pounding. She had always paid her taxes on time. But the caller was so convincing — he knew her full name, he sounded official, and he even gave her a "badge number." Dorothy drove to the her local pharmacy and bought $500 in iTunes cards before she called her daughter, who told her to hang up immediately.</p>
        <p>Dorothy lost that $500. But she learned something powerful that day: scammers are professional liars. They practise sounding real. They use fear and urgency as weapons. And once you know their tricks, you can spot them from a mile away.</p>
        <p>This module is Dorothy's gift to you — everything she wishes she had known before that phone call.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Truth About Scams in Canada</h2>

      <p>Before we look at specific scams, here are some facts that might surprise you:</p>

      <ul class="content-list">
        <li>The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre reported that Canadians lost over <strong>$530 million</strong> to fraud in a recent year. The real number is likely much higher because many people feel too embarrassed to report it.</li>
        <li>Scammers do not target people who are foolish — they target people who are <strong>trusting, polite, and law-abiding</strong>. Those are good qualities. Scammers exploit them.</li>
        <li>Being scammed is <strong>not your fault</strong>. These are professional criminals who do this for a living.</li>
        <li>The best defence is not technical skill — it is <strong>knowing what to look for</strong>. That is exactly what we are about to learn.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="three-second-rule">
        <h3>The 3-Second Rule</h3>
        <p>Use this every time something feels "off" — on your phone, in your email, or on a website.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="three-second-rule-box">
        <h4>Remember the 3-Second Rule</h4>
        <p>Stop. Breathe. Think before you tap. If something feels urgent or too good to be true, that is your signal to pause.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Scam 1: The CRA Phone Scam</h2>

      <p>This is the most common scam targeting Canadians. Here is how it works:</p>

      <div class="scam-example">
        <span class="example-label">What the scam call sounds like</span>
        <p>"This is Officer James Wilson, badge number 4471, calling from the Canada Revenue Agency. Our records indicate you have an outstanding tax debt of $4,200. A warrant for your arrest has been issued. To avoid immediate arrest, you must make a payment today. We accept payment through iTunes gift cards, Bitcoin, or wire transfer. Press 1 to speak with a payment agent."</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Red Flags to Watch For:</h3>
      <ul class="red-flags">
        <li><strong>The CRA will never call and threaten arrest.</strong> If you owed taxes, they would send you a letter in the mail first — multiple letters, in fact.</li>
        <li><strong>No government agency accepts iTunes gift cards as payment.</strong> This is the biggest giveaway. Gift cards are untraceable — that is exactly why scammers want them.</li>
        <li><strong>They create false urgency.</strong> "You must pay today" or "the police are on their way" — real government agencies give you time to respond.</li>
        <li><strong>They get angry or threatening when you ask questions.</strong> A real CRA agent would be patient and professional.</li>
        <li><strong>They ask you to stay on the phone.</strong> They do not want you calling someone else to check if this is real.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Applying the 3-Second Rule:</h3>
      <p><strong>Stop:</strong> Hang up the phone. You do not need to be polite to a criminal. <strong>Breathe:</strong> Remember that the CRA sends letters, not threatening phone calls. <strong>Verify:</strong> If you are worried, call the CRA directly at <strong>1-800-959-8281</strong> (this is their real number — you can find it on canada.ca).</p>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <span class="warning-box-label">Watch Out</span>
        <p>No real government agency will ever ask you to pay using gift cards, Bitcoin, or wire transfers. If someone asks for payment this way, it is always a scam — no exceptions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="three-second-rule-box">
        <h4>Remember the 3-Second Rule</h4>
        <p>Stop. Breathe. Think before you tap. If something feels urgent or too good to be true, that is your signal to pause.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>What to Do If You Already Responded:</h3>
      <p>If you gave them gift card numbers, contact the gift card company immediately — they may be able to freeze the funds. Report the scam to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at <strong>1-888-495-8501</strong>. Do not feel embarrassed; you are helping protect others by reporting.</p>

      <div class="image-placeholder" role="img" aria-label="Phone screen showing an unknown caller — do not answer">
        <div class="placeholder-inner">
          <div class="placeholder-icon-wrap">📵</div>
          <div class="placeholder-text-wrap">
            <span class="placeholder-label">Screenshot needed</span>

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="confidence-check">
        <span class="check-icon">💛</span>
        <p>Confidence Check: You can now spot a CRA scam. That puts you ahead of the curve. Well done.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <span class="tip-box-label">Tip</span>
        <p>Save the real CRA phone number (1-800-959-8281) in your phone's contacts list right now. That way, if you ever receive a suspicious call about taxes, you can ring the real CRA directly to check.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Scam 2: The Grandparent Scam</h2>

      <p>This scam is particularly cruel because it targets your love for your family.</p>

      <div class="scam-example">
        <span class="example-label">What the scam call sounds like</span>
        <p>"Grandma? It's me... [sobbing]... I'm in trouble. I was in a car accident in Montreal and I got arrested. Please don't tell Mom and Dad. My lawyer says I need $3,000 for bail. Can you send money through Western Union? Please, Grandma, I'm so scared."</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Red Flags to Watch For:</h3>
      <ul class="red-flags">
        <li><strong>They never say their name first.</strong> They wait for you to say "Is that you, Michael?" and then they say "Yes, it's Michael!" Now they know your grandchild's name.</li>
        <li><strong>They beg you not to tell other family members.</strong> They need to isolate you so no one can verify the story.</li>
        <li><strong>The "lawyer" calls back.</strong> A second person calls pretending to be a lawyer, confirming the fake story. This makes it feel more real.</li>
        <li><strong>They need money urgently through untraceable methods.</strong> Wire transfers, gift cards, or cryptocurrency.</li>
        <li><strong>Their voice sounds "off."</strong> They often explain this by saying they have a cold, or that the phone connection is bad.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Applying the 3-Second Rule:</h3>
      <p><strong>Stop:</strong> Do not send money. <strong>Breathe:</strong> Fear for a loved one is the most powerful emotion scammers can use. Take a moment. <strong>Verify:</strong> Hang up and call your grandchild directly at the phone number you already have. Call their parents. If your real grandchild answers and says "What are you talking about, Grandma?" — you have just avoided a scam.</p>

      <div class="tip-block">
        <span class="tip-label">Family Safety Tip</span>
        <p>Consider creating a <strong>family code word</strong> — a secret word that only your family knows. If someone calls claiming to be a relative in trouble, ask for the code word. A scammer will not know it.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <span class="warning-box-label">Watch Out</span>
        <p>Scammers can now use artificial intelligence to clone voices. Even if a caller sounds exactly like your grandchild, always hang up and call your family member directly at the number you already have saved.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="three-second-rule-box">
        <h4>Remember the 3-Second Rule</h4>
        <p>Stop. Breathe. Think before you tap. If something feels urgent or too good to be true, that is your signal to pause.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Scam 3: Fake Bank Emails (Phishing)</h2>

      <p><strong>Phishing</strong> (pronounced "fishing") is when a scammer sends you a fake email or text message pretending to be from a company you trust — like your bank. They are "fishing" for your personal information, hoping you will take the bait.</p>

      <div class="scam-example">
        <span class="example-label">Example fake email from "RBC"</span>
        <p>From: security-alert@rbc-banking-secure.com<br>
        Subject: URGENT: Unusual Activity on Your RBC Account<br><br>
        Dear Valued Customer,<br><br>
        We have detected unusual activity on your RBC Royal Bank account. Your account has been temporarily locked for your protection. To restore access, please verify your identity by clicking the link below:<br><br>
        [Verify My Account Now]<br><br>
        If you do not verify within 24 hours, your account will be permanently closed.<br><br>
        RBC Royal Bank Security Team</p>
      </div>

      <div class="image-placeholder" role="img" aria-label="Example of a phishing email with red flags highlighted">
        <div class="placeholder-inner">
          <div class="placeholder-icon-wrap">📧</div>
          <div class="placeholder-text-wrap">
            <span class="placeholder-label">Screenshot needed</span>
            <p class="placeholder-caption">Example of a phishing email with red flags highlighted</p>
            <p class="placeholder-dims">Recommended: 800 × 600 px</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Red Flags to Watch For:</h3>
      <ul class="red-flags">
        <li><strong>The email address is wrong.</strong> Look carefully: "rbc-banking-secure.com" is NOT a real RBC address. The real one would end in "@rbc.com" — nothing else.</li>
        <li><strong>It says "Dear Valued Customer" instead of your actual name.</strong> Your real bank knows your name.</li>
        <li><strong>"URGENT" and deadline pressure.</strong> "You have 24 hours" is designed to make you panic and act without thinking.</li>
        <li><strong>They want you to click a link.</strong> That link leads to a fake website that looks like your bank but is controlled by the scammer. If you type your password there, you are handing it to a thief.</li>
        <li><strong>Threatening language.</strong> "Your account will be permanently closed" — your bank would not close your account over one missed email.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Applying the 3-Second Rule:</h3>
      <p><strong>Stop:</strong> Do not click any links in the email. <strong>Breathe:</strong> Your bank account is fine. Real security issues are handled by phone, not email links. <strong>Verify:</strong> Open a brand-new web browser window (do not use any links from the email) and go to your bank's real website by typing the address yourself. Or call the number on the back of your bank card.</p>

      <div class="scam-example">
        <span class="example-label">Example fake email from "TD Bank"</span>

      <p>Notice the same pattern: fake email address ("td-bank-alert.net" is not a real TD address), urgency ("12 hours"), and a link that wants your login information. The real TD website address is <strong>td.com</strong> — anything else is fake.</p>

      <h2>Scam 4: Romance Scams</h2>

      <p>Romance scams often begin on social media or dating apps. Someone sends you a kind message, you start chatting, and over weeks or months they build a relationship with you. Then the requests for money begin.</p>

      <div class="scam-example">
        <span class="example-label">How it typically unfolds</span>
        <p>Week 1: "Hello, I noticed your lovely profile photo. My name is Robert, I'm an engineer working in Alberta."<br><br>
        Week 3: Daily messages, phone calls, deep personal conversations. He is kind, attentive, everything you could want.<br><br>
        Week 6: "I'm stuck overseas on a job. I need $2,000 for a plane ticket home. I'll pay you back as soon as I arrive. You're the only person I can trust."</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Red Flags to Watch For:</h3>
      <ul class="red-flags">
        <li><strong>They cannot video call.</strong> Their camera is always "broken" or the connection is always "bad." They use photos stolen from other people's social media.</li>
        <li><strong>The relationship moves very fast.</strong> They say "I love you" within days or weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>They have a dramatic reason they cannot meet in person.</strong> They are overseas, in the military, working on an oil rig, or some other story.</li>
        <li><strong>They eventually ask for money.</strong> It starts small and grows. Medical emergency, travel costs, business problems.</li>
        <li><strong>They ask you to keep the relationship private.</strong> They do not want your family or friends to ask questions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Applying the 3-Second Rule:</h3>
      <p><strong>Stop:</strong> Never send money to someone you have not met in person. <strong>Breathe:</strong> This is emotionally difficult. It is okay to feel hurt or confused. <strong>Verify:</strong> Do a reverse image search of their profile photo (your family member or a tech helper can show you how), or ask them for a video call. If they always have an excuse, that is your answer.</p>

      <h2>Scam 5: Tech Support Scams</h2>

      <p>This scam usually starts with a phone call or a pop-up on your screen.</p>

      <div class="device-content" data-devices="iphone,ipad">
      <div class="scam-example">

      <h3>Red Flags to Watch For:</h3>

        <li><strong>Apple, Microsoft, and Google will never call you about a problem you did not report.</strong> If you did not contact them first, the call is fake.</li>
        <li><strong>They ask for remote access to your device.</strong> Never let a stranger control your iPad or computer.</li>
        <li><strong>They charge a fee to "fix" a problem that does not exist.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>They found you — you did not find them.</strong> Real tech support waits for you to contact them.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Applying the 3-Second Rule:</h3>
      <p><strong>Stop:</strong> Hang up. <strong>Breathe:</strong> Apple did not call you. Your iPad is fine. <strong>Verify:</strong> If you are worried about your device, visit your nearest Apple Store or call Apple directly at <strong>1-800-275-2273</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Applying the 3-Second Rule:</h3>
      <p><strong>Stop:</strong> Hang up. <strong>Breathe:</strong> Google did not call you. Your Android device is fine. <strong>Verify:</strong> If you are worried about your device, visit the support website for your device manufacturer (such as <strong>support.google.com</strong> for Google Pixel, or <strong>samsung.com/ca/support</strong> for Samsung), or ask a trusted family member or friend to take a look.</p>

      <h3>Red Flags to Watch For:</h3>
      <ul class="red-flags">
        <li><strong>Microsoft will never call you about a problem you did not report.</strong> If you did not contact them first, the call is 100% fake.</li>
        <li><strong>They ask for remote access to your computer.</strong> Never let a stranger connect to your Windows computer. This would give them full control and access to all your files.</li>
        <li><strong>They charge a fee to "fix" a problem that does not exist.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>They create urgency.</strong> "Hackers are stealing your information right now" is designed to panic you into acting before you think.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Applying the 3-Second Rule:</h3>
      <p><strong>Stop:</strong> Hang up immediately. <strong>Breathe:</strong> Microsoft did not call you. Your Windows computer is fine. <strong>Verify:</strong> If you are genuinely concerned about your computer, contact Microsoft directly at <strong>support.microsoft.com</strong> or call a local, trusted computer repair shop — never the person who called you.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Scam 6: Fake Package Delivery Texts</h2>

      <div class="scam-example">
        <span class="example-label">Example scam text message</span>
        <p>Canada Post: Your package could not be delivered. A shipping fee of $2.65 is required. Pay now to reschedule delivery: http://canadapost-redelivery-fee.com/pay</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Red Flags to Watch For:</h3>
      <ul class="red-flags">
        <li><strong>Canada Post does not text you about delivery fees.</strong> If there is a fee, they leave a notice card in your mailbox.</li>
        <li><strong>The link looks almost right but is not.</strong> "canadapost-redelivery-fee.com" is not a real Canada Post website. The real one is <strong>canadapost-postescanada.ca</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>The amount is small on purpose.</strong> They hope you will think "$2.65 is no big deal" and enter your credit card number without thinking. Then they have your card number.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Applying the 3-Second Rule:</h3>
      <p><strong>Stop:</strong> Do not tap the link. <strong>Breathe:</strong> If you are expecting a package, check the real Canada Post website directly. <strong>Verify:</strong> Go to <strong>canadapost-postescanada.ca</strong> and use the tracking number from your order confirmation email.</p>

      <h2>Scam 7: "Microsoft" Computer Warnings</h2>

      <p>While browsing the web, a full-screen warning suddenly appears:</p>

      <div class="image-placeholder" role="img" aria-label="Fake virus warning popup in a browser">

      </div>

      <h3>Red Flags to Watch For:</h3>
      <ul class="red-flags">
        <li><strong>Microsoft does not send warnings through your web browser.</strong> This is a webpage, not a real system alert.</li>
        <li><strong>Error codes that look official but mean nothing.</strong> "Error # DW6BD36" is made up to sound technical.</li>
        <li><strong>It tells you NOT to close the window.</strong> The opposite of what you should do — close it immediately using your Escape Hatch from Module 1.</li>
        <li><strong>A phone number.</strong> Real warnings from your operating system never include a phone number to call.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Applying the 3-Second Rule:</h3>
      <div class="device-content" data-devices="iphone,ipad">
      <p><strong>Stop:</strong> Take your fingers off the screen. <strong>Breathe:</strong> This is a fake website, not a real warning. <strong>Verify:</strong> Press the Home button on your iPad (your Escape Hatch!) to close the browser.

When you reopen Chrome, the warning will be gone. Your device was never in danger. If the fake warning page is still showing when you reopen Chrome, simply close that browser tab by tapping the small "X" on the tab, or clear your recent tabs.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="device-content" data-devices="windows">
      <p><strong>Stop:</strong> Take your hands off the keyboard and mouse. <strong>Breathe:</strong> This is a webpage, not a real Windows warning. Your computer was never in danger. <strong>Verify:</strong> Close the browser window using the <strong>X button</strong> in the top right corner, or press <strong>Alt + F4</strong>. If the warning will not let you close it, press <strong>Ctrl + Alt + Delete</strong> → Task Manager → find your browser (Edge or Chrome) → End Task. When you reopen your browser, the fake warning will be gone. Real Windows security alerts appear as small notifications in the bottom right corner of your screen — never as full-screen browser pages with phone numbers.</p>

      <h2>Your Master Scam-Spotting Checklist</h2>

      <p>You can use these questions to evaluate any suspicious message, email, phone call, or website. If the answer to any of these is "yes," it is very likely a scam:</p>

      <ul class="content-list">
        <li>Does it create <strong>urgency</strong>? ("Act now!" "You have 24 hours!")</li>
        <li>Does it create <strong>fear</strong>? ("Your account is locked!" "The police are coming!")</li>
        <li>Does it ask for <strong>unusual payment methods</strong>? (Gift cards, wire transfers, cryptocurrency)</li>
        <li>Does it ask you to <strong>click a link</strong> to fix a problem?</li>
        <li>Did <strong>they contact you first</strong>, rather than you contacting them?</li>
        <li>Does it ask you to <strong>keep it secret</strong> from family?</li>
        <li>Does the email address or website look <strong>almost right but not quite</strong>?</li>
        <li>Is the greeting <strong>generic</strong> ("Dear Customer") rather than using your name?</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Practical Exercise: The Red Flag Detector</h3>
        <p>For the next week, practise the 3-Second Rule with every unexpected message or call you receive. Keep a small notebook by your phone and write down:</p>

        <ol class="numbered-list">
          <li>What was the message or call about?</li>
          <li>Did it create urgency or fear?</li>
          <li>Did it ask me to click something or pay something?</li>
          <li>Did they contact me first, or did I contact them?</li>
          <li>What did I do? (Hung up, deleted it, ignored it — all great choices!)</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="success-state">
          <strong>Success looks like this:</strong> You can calmly identify at least three red flags in any scam message. You no longer feel panicked when you receive a suspicious call or email — instead, you feel prepared and in control.
